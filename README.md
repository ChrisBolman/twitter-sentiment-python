Text Analysis with Python Redux
========================

*Please note:* This repo is in response to [An introduction to text analysis with Python](http://nealcaren.web.unc.edu/an-introduction-to-text-analysis-with-python-part-1/) by Neal Caren. I found a slight error in his code, which skewed the results. 

Before the Changes
--------------

First, run the results using the original code. 

1. Download sentiment_before.py
2. Run the file. This will create a CSV with the results of the analysis. 

Next, take a look at the modified code, highlighting the error.

1. Download sentiment_error.py
2. Run the file.
